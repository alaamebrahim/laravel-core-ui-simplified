# Laravel with core ui

This is Pure laravel installation with simplified version of core ui admin panel.

- I just Installed core ui admin panel login/register/dashboard home layouts from <a href="https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-laravel-admin-template/" taget="_blank">coreui/coreui-free-laravel-admin-template</a>
- You will need to tweak Logo image to adjust your need, also you will need to change site name from mine to yours.

## Installation

- Clone OR download this repo.
- Change .env data to adjust your needs and database.
- Run `composer install`.
- Run `npm install && npm run dev`.

## Remember

- It may be useful to you and it may be not, i just wanted to give those who wanted a lite version without other components to start development operation faster, and save them half an hour of work or so.
- It's a pure laravel installation, so feel free to upgrade your laravel version to the latest.
- Explore webpack.mix.js file and comment/uncomment ui components that fit your needs.
